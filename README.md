## Description

In This Project, the focus was to take a simple note taking website and turn it into an application that can be downloaded and utilized offline via desktop application.

### User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes directly from my desktop, with or without internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use.
```

### Tools and Technologies Used

To create this application, I used:
- IndexedDB (via the idb package) 
- Webpack to bundle front-end code
- Workbox to create a service worker that caches static assets
- And Heroku to deploy the website
